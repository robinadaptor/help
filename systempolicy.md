# System Policy   

***


## Energy Saving, Knowledge Intensive System   

First of all, we believe that future cryptocurrency will be transformed into knowledge intensive and energy saving system. An example is proof of stake(POS) conversion of Ethereum. In bitcore layer, proof of stake systems have been rapidly improved into Dash fork system.   

Proof of stake systems are energy-saving systems that also help to preserve the environment. And knowledge-intensive systems will upgrade cryptocurrency. Knowledge-intensive systems are expected to develop into sufficient value-added industries.   



## Transparent Cryptocurrency Policy   

National cryptocurrency policies are different. We decided to support the transparent trading policy with the recent increase in the crime rate of dark coins. It is a white coin policy.   

It is thought that white coins will contribute to popularization. It is believed that the transparency of transaction logs and the transparency of coin volume can reduce social crime, which is a suitable model for blockchain plus.   



## Preservation of Cryptocurrency Assets   

Cryptocurrency is the business of the future industry combining technology and credit. Many cryptocurrencies have emerged and disappeared to date.  

The disappearance of cryptocurrency has been caused by various factors, such as business bankruptcy, poor management, and lack of technology. Therefore, we studied the technology that can restore digital assets without destroying them as a way to protect customers' assets.   

Preserving customer assets is the most important part of the credit business.   
   


## Decentralized network system

Robin Project opposes centralization policy. In addition to simply decentralization core systems, we want to drive decentralization policies for all infrastructure systems.   

I think all systems such as social networks, exchanges, markets, forum site, portal site, etc. should be decentralized. I think it will develop into a truly democratic and human engineering system.
