# System Policy

## Energy Saving, Knowledge Intensive System   

First of all, we believe that future cryptocurrency will be transformed into knowledge intensive and energy saving system. An example is proof of stake(POS) conversion of Ethereum. In bitcore layer, proof of stake systems have been rapidly improved into Dash fork system.   

Proof of stake systems are energy-saving systems that also help to preserve the environment. And knowledge-intensive systems will upgrade cryptocurrency. Knowledge-intensive systems are expected to develop into sufficient value-added industries.   



## Transparent Cryptocurrency Policy   

National cryptocurrency policies are different. We decided to support the transparent trading policy with the recent increase in the crime rate of dark coins. It is a white coin policy.   

It is thought that white coins will contribute to popularization. It is believed that the transparency of transaction logs and the transparency of coin volume can reduce social crime, which is a suitable model for blockchain plus.
