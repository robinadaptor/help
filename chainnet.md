# ChainNet   

***


## Communication protocol between gateway chain systems    

Blockchain has evolved into various models. In the near future, standard communication protocols between these advanced system families will be needed. Unlike a centralized system, blockchain cannot forge data and protect digital assets from external heckers.   

In order to eliminate the weakness of the centralized system, the blockchain will be able to communicate with another blockchain, and even among those blockchain groups. It is likely that standardized communication protocols will be needed to enable such a system. We decided to call it a chainnet.   

In the future, chainnet will evolve into another giant internet. Chainnet will also be able to communicate with gateway groups, gateway, and public/private nodes.   

We simply defined a chainnet data packet.   


```
-----------------------------------------
header	chain transfer protocol (CTP)
-----------------------------------------

pn	protocol name (CTP)
ver	protocol version
type	data format
length	data length
tid	top chain id key
cid	gateway chain id key
gid	gateway id key
pid	peer id key
pubkey	public key
code	return code
date	lasttime

-----------------------------------------
data	data information
-----------------------------------------

```

Do we maintain a true blockchain ecosystem?

Distributed systems include extensive infrastructure, but sometimes they must also encompass individual systems. We think that is the comprehensive mercy of a true distributed system.

Individual bloggers should not mislead the ecosystem of entire distributed system and lead the black culture. It is desirable to maintain the system based on the ideas and operational efforts of each. The start of the blockchain is therefore more meaningful. We each need to form our own unique infrastructure. 

We think that leading and defining our world correctly is an important choice for our future. True chainnet will come closer to reality.
