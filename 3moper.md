## Multi coin, Multi/Tier node, Multi Protocol/Diversification Operation    

3M oper refers to the operation of three M initials: mulit coin, multi node, and multi protocol. This makes the blockchain ecosystem more stable. It also guarantees the integrity of data to compensate for data forgery and weaknesses in the centralized system. 3M oper is one such unit system.    

We published that Robincash is implemented on 3M oper system. Robincash realized a free swap deal with each other cryptocurrencies on [`Chamber Ex`](https://robinadaptor.github.io/chamber/). This is an implementation of our loadmap.    

The blockchain system will operate various roles in the coming future. 3M oper system will continue to improve in the future.
