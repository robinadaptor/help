# Swap Policy    

***


## Free Listing   

Chamber Ex promotes free listing for fair opportunities on all cryptocurrencies. However, if deemed inadequate maintainence, the cryptocurrency will be delisted. We also hope to contribute to the development of blockchain. Currently only Bitcoin, Dash and Pivx forking systems are supported.   

If you want free listing, please visit our discord(https://discordapp.com/invite/zYvFFJU) and send a message to Robinadaptor.   



## Minimal Trading Commission  

We are trying to minimize the trading commission at Chamber Ex. However, if the profit of the swap portal deteriorates, it is difficult to operate, so we try to require only a minimum commission.  



## Distributed Asset Management Policy

Chamber Ex does not have its own cryptocurrencies wallet. The hard/cold wallet of the cryptocurrency on Chamber Ex is directly managed by the cryptocurrency development company.   

Therefore, the cryptocurrency development company will pay more attention to the security for keeping theirs. Exchange wallet decentralization policy allows you to keep your assets safe from hackers.   

Exchange wallet decentralization policy, all cryptocurrency developers will do their best for safe management.
